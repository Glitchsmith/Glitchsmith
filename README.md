- 👋 Hi, I’m @Glitchsmith
- 👀 I’m interested in creating cheats and hacks that are 100% undetectable, and have quick insurance. This works by having multiple copies of the file, and when one file has a bug or crashes, another one takes its place. The central Database has all information needed for this, and the program can fix itself in a day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning undetectable code and security bypassing programs and software, that uses the hard disk.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Discord. @Glitchax
- 📫 How to reach me by Discord DM.
